    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am aspiring Software Engineer pursuing a Computer Science degree at the University of Houston -Downtown. I will be graduating at the end of the Fall 2020 semester so I am very excited to start my career. Currently I am working in Information Technology (IT) for Houston Independent School District, I help teachers and staff with technology. I got introduced to computer science when I was in high school and took a course called "computer science". From there my curiosity took over and fell in love with programming. Some things I like to do in my free time is play video games and soccer. The game I spend the most time playing is League of legends. I also like to program random ideas that I get and also like to do some coding challenges on Leetcode. My first language was Java then got proficient in C++ but my favorite language is Python at the moment. Python is very easy to make quick programs with easy syntax. You can check out my repository at <a href="https://github.com/AlexxNino">Github</a> to see the projects I have started and contributed. The most fun team project was when I took a game development course. I loved seeing and interacting with all the ideas that we brainstormed and brought the idea to life.
